# Password Security Migration - Quick Start

## 🔐 Critical Security Update

This project has implemented secure password hashing to replace plain text password storage.

## ✅ What's Been Fixed

- **Passwords are now hashed** using bcrypt (industry standard)
- **Database is secure** - passwords cannot be read if compromised
- **Authentication remains the same** - users don't need to change anything
- **Mock data is secure** - development environment uses hashed passwords

## 🚀 Quick Migration (Production)

For **existing production databases** with plain text passwords:

```bash
# 1. Backup your database first!
# 2. Run the migration
APP_ENV=production npm run migrate:passwords
```

For **staging environment**:
```bash
APP_ENV=staging npm run migrate:passwords
```

## ✅ Verification

The migration script automatically validates that all passwords are properly hashed.

## 👥 User Impact

**Zero impact** - users can continue logging in with their existing passwords. The system now securely hashes and verifies them instead of storing/comparing plain text.

## 🔧 Development

- **Mock users** (luke@rebels.com, darth@empire.com) still use password: `changeme`
- **Tests pass** - all authentication functionality works as before
- **New users** automatically get hashed passwords

## 📚 Full Documentation

See [PASSWORD_SECURITY.md](./PASSWORD_SECURITY.md) for complete implementation details.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Backup before migration** - hashed passwords cannot be reversed to plain text
2. **Run migration once** - the script detects and skips already hashed passwords
3. **Production ready** - this is a security best practice implementation using bcrypt

---

**TL;DR:** Run `APP_ENV=production npm run migrate:passwords` on your production database to secure all existing passwords. Everything else works exactly the same.
