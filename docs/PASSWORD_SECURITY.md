# Password Security Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of secure password handling in the Unconference-Me application, replacing the previous insecure plain text password storage with industry-standard bcrypt hashing.

## Security Issues Addressed

### Before Implementation
- ❌ **Plain text password storage** in CosmosDB and mock data
- ❌ **Plain text password comparison** in authentication
- ❌ **Passwords visible in database** without encryption
- ❌ **Security vulnerability** if database is compromised

### After Implementation
- ✅ **bcrypt password hashing** with salt rounds of 12
- ✅ **Secure password verification** using bcrypt.compare()
- ✅ **Passwords are unreadable** in database storage
- ✅ **Industry-standard security** practices implemented

## Implementation Details

### 1. Password Utility Service (`utils/password.ts`)

```typescript
export class PasswordUtils {
  private static readonly SALT_ROUNDS = 12

  static async hashPassword(plainPassword: string): Promise<string>
  static async verifyPassword(plainPassword: string, hashedPassword: string): Promise<boolean>
  static isPasswordHashed(password: string): boolean
  static generateRandomPassword(length: number = 16): string
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Uses bcrypt with 12 salt rounds for optimal security/performance balance
- Detects already hashed passwords to prevent double-hashing
- Provides secure password verification
- Includes random password generation utility

### 2. User Service Updates

The `userService` has been updated to automatically hash passwords:

**`create()` method:**
- Automatically hashes plain text passwords before storage
- Skips hashing if password is already hashed (prevents double-hashing)

**`update()` method:**
- Hashes new passwords when updating user records
- Preserves existing hashed passwords when not updating password field

**`validateCredentials()` method:**
- Uses bcrypt to verify passwords instead of plain text comparison
- Returns null for invalid credentials (secure failure mode)

### 3. Authentication Flow Updates

**Login Endpoint (`server/api/auth/login.post.ts`):**
- Simplified to use `userService.validateCredentials()` 
- Eliminates redundant user lookup and password comparison
- Provides consistent error handling for invalid credentials

**Registration Endpoint:**
- Automatically uses the updated `userService.create()` method
- New user passwords are hashed before database storage

### 4. Mock Data Security

**Mock Data Manager:**
- Uses pre-computed bcrypt hashes for test users
- Default password "changeme" is stored as: `$2b$12$LQv3c1yqBWVHxkd0LHAkCOYz6TtxMQJqhN8/LebleWI/qLW4Sf3u2`
- Maintains consistency between development and production security practices

### 5. Database Migration

**Migration Script (`scripts/migrate-passwords.ts`):**
```bash
npm run migrate:passwords
```

This script:
- Identifies users with plain text passwords
- Hashes existing plain text passwords using bcrypt
- Updates database records with secure hashed passwords
- Validates migration completion
- Provides detailed migration statistics

## Usage Instructions

### For New Installations
No additional steps needed - all new passwords are automatically hashed.

### For Existing Installations
1. **Run the migration script** to hash existing passwords:
   ```bash
   # For staging environment
   APP_ENV=staging npm run migrate:passwords
   
   # For production environment  
   APP_ENV=production npm run migrate:passwords
   ```

2. **Verify migration** - the script includes validation to ensure all passwords are properly hashed.

### For Development
- Mock data automatically uses hashed passwords
- Test users (luke@rebels.com, darth@empire.com) use password: "changeme"
- All new test users created through the system use hashed passwords

### For Production Deployment
- Admin users created via population scripts use hashed passwords
- Environment variables for admin passwords are hashed before storage
- CosmosDB stores only hashed passwords, never plain text

## Security Benefits

### 1. **Protection Against Data Breaches**
- Even if database is compromised, passwords cannot be read directly
- bcrypt hashes are computationally expensive to crack

### 2. **Salt Protection**
- Each password uses a unique salt (built into bcrypt)
- Prevents rainbow table attacks
- Each hash is unique even for identical passwords

### 3. **Adaptive Security**
- Salt rounds can be increased as computing power grows
- Current setting (12 rounds) provides strong security with reasonable performance

### 4. **Industry Standard**
- bcrypt is widely adopted and battle-tested
- Meets modern security compliance requirements
- Follows OWASP password storage guidelines

## Technical Specifications

### Bcrypt Configuration
- **Algorithm:** bcrypt
- **Salt Rounds:** 12
- **Hash Format:** `$2b$12$[22-character salt][31-character hash]`
- **Total Length:** ~60 characters

### Performance Impact
- **Hashing:** ~100-200ms per password (intentionally slow for security)
- **Verification:** ~100-200ms per login attempt
- **Memory:** Minimal additional memory usage
- **Storage:** ~60 bytes per password (vs ~10-20 for plain text)

### Backward Compatibility
- Migration script ensures smooth transition from plain text
- `isPasswordHashed()` utility prevents accidental double-hashing
- Existing authentication flows work without API changes

## Testing

### Automated Tests
- **Password Security Tests:** Verify hashing and verification functionality
- **Authentication Tests:** Ensure login still works with hashed passwords
- **Migration Tests:** Validate password migration process

### Test Commands
```bash
# Test password security functionality
APP_ENV=test npx playwright test password-security.spec.ts

# Test authentication with hashed passwords  
APP_ENV=test npx playwright test auth.spec.ts

# Run all security-related tests
APP_ENV=test npm run test
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. **Monitor migration logs** during deployment to production
2. **Validate password security** in security audits
3. **Consider increasing salt rounds** as computing power increases (every 2-3 years)

### Security Auditing
```bash
# Verify no plain text passwords remain in database
npm run migrate:passwords -- --validate-only
```

## Rollback Plan

In case of issues, the migration can be rolled back by:

1. **Identifying affected users** from migration logs
2. **Restoring from database backup** if necessary  
3. **Re-running migration** with fixes applied

**Note:** Plain text passwords cannot be recovered from hashed passwords - backup before migration is essential.

## Compliance

This implementation addresses:
- ✅ **GDPR** - Secure processing of personal data (passwords)
- ✅ **SOC 2** - Secure password storage requirements
- ✅ **OWASP** - Password Storage Cheat Sheet compliance
- ✅ **NIST** - Digital Identity Guidelines (SP 800-63B)

## Next Steps

### Future Enhancements
1. **Password complexity requirements** - Implement minimum complexity rules
2. **Password history** - Prevent reuse of recent passwords  
3. **Multi-factor authentication** - Add 2FA for enhanced security
4. **Password expiration** - Optional password aging policies
5. **Account lockout** - Prevent brute force attacks

### Monitoring Improvements
1. **Failed login tracking** - Monitor and alert on suspicious activity
2. **Password strength analysis** - Report on user password quality
3. **Security metrics dashboard** - Track authentication security metrics
